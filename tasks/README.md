## optimize-svg.sh
This script iterates through all SVG files in predefined directories and optimizes them.
Use of `npm run svgo` is recommended to run this script, but you can also invoke it directly: `./tasks/optimize-svg.sh`.

Currently iterated directories:
* `./app/symbols`

If you've added SVGs in different directory please update the script and this README file.
